The one exception is projectile weapons, which usually require a burst of energy far exceeding what the generator produces. Supercapacitors provide just enough energy storage for those weapons, without requiring you to install a bulky battery pack."

Some pilots have even been known to install these in lieu of any generator at all, trusting that they can reach their destination planet and recharge before running out of battery power, but that is a risky proposition."

However, battery packs have the advantage that they generate no heat, so some captains use them instead of powerful generators if they do not expect to be in combat frequently or for extended periods of time."
