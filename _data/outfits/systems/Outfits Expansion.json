  "description": "This expansion allows you to sacrifice some cargo space in order to make room for more outfits, in situations where you need just a bit more space to install a particular system. It does not increase your weapon or engine space. Unfortunately, rearranging the interior of your ship in such a fundamental way tends to interfere with its cooling systems."
