  "description": "This scanner allows you to determine what outfits are installed in the ship you are currently targeting, if you are willing to risk flying close enough to it to get a reading! The Republic Navy uses these scanners to detect when ships are equipped with illegal weaponry. Installing more than one increases the scan range and speed."
