  "description": "Ramscoop technology has been almost unchanged for centuries, because with nearly every system in human space settled there has not been a pressing need for ships to generate their own fuel. But with the Free Worlds war making travel once again more difficult, some engineers in the Deep recently invented a much-improved ramscoop for use in their merchant fleets."
