  "description": "The Proton Gun started out as the Syndicate's attempt to reverse engineer and mass produce a cheap competitor for the Particle Cannon. Unfortunately, they were unable to find a reliable way to keep the beam coherent, but the resulting weapon is still popular with some captains, particularly as an anti-fighter gun."
