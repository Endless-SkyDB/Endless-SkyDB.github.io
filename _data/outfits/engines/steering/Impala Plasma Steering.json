    "description": "Impala class plasma steering systems are suitable for most freighters and all but the largest warships, and are also considerably more compact than the ion propulsion systems produced by the Syndicate. Plasma engines are a bit more powerful than ion engines of the same size, but they are less energy efficient and produce more heat."
