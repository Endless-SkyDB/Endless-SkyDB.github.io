	"description": "The ionic afterburner was designed by the Syndicate to compensate for the primary weakness of an ordinary afterburner: namely, that it consumes hyperspace fuel at a prodigious rate. Ionic afterburners instead use a small amount of fuel combined with a large burst of energy from your ship's batteries to achieve the same effect."
