    "description": "The X5700 thruster is intended for only the largest of capital ships. When the Syndicate first began producing them, these engines were considered little more than a publicity stunt, because no ship at the time was large enough to hold one. Ion engines consume less energy than plasma engines and produce less heat, but they also take up more space."
