    "description": "Impala class thrusters produce a significant amount of force, and are suitable for smaller capital ships. But, your ship may need extra cooling systems in order to handle them. Plasma engines are a bit more powerful than ion engines of the same size, but they are less energy efficient and produce more heat."
