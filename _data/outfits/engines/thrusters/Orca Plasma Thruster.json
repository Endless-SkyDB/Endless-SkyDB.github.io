    "description": "This engine draws enough power that a ship with anything short of a full-fledged nuclear reactor is unlikely to be able to use it, but the thrust it generates is impressive. Plasma engines are a bit more powerful than ion engines of the same size, but they are less energy efficient and produce more heat."
