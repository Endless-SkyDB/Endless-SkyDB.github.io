  "description": "The Betelgeuse Shipyards Firebird is a warship with a long and storied past; Firebirds fought on both sides of the Alpha Wars over half a millennium ago, and although the equipment and systems have been upgraded continuously since then, the basic design remains almost the same. The Firebird is also a very rugged ship and easy to repair; supposedly a few of the Firebirds that fought in those wars are still in service today."
