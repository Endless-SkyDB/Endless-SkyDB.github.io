  "description": "`This particular cockpit and engine set has found itself attached to three of Southbound Shipyards' new Type F Fighter-carrier pods. When the Free Worlds asked for a carrier, they did not expect one that would be able to carry more fighters than even the heaviest Navy warships. Given this fact, the Free Worlds have asked Southbound and Tarazed to restrict sale of the Hauler III: Type F, Skein to its Militia only.`"
