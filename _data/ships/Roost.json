  "description": "`Southbound Shipyards' new fighter-carrying containers have created a new use for what many considered an outdated design. Four external fighter bays make this the biggest civilian carrier on the market, if a little awkward as a warship. After Southbound assembly workers successfully named the Nest, Hauler II: Type F was quickly dubbed the Roost to continue the theme.`"
