	"description": "Saryds place high value both on solitude, but also on community and collaboration. So, it is not surprising that their smallest spacefaring vessel requires a team of at least two individuals to operate it. It is quite common for a lone Saryd to take on a Kimek or Arach copilot as a way of building cross-species friendships."
