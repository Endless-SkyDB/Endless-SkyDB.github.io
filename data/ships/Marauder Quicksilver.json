	"description": "This Megaparsec Quicksilver is a bit of a Hotrod, being a little faster, with extra shield projectors, hull plating, and an extra bunk. This aftermarket model also features a turret mount, perhaps in an answer to Lionheart's Headhunter. The shop that built this ship is sure to see more customers."
