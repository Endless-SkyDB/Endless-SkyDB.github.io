	"description": "The Splinter is the largest warship produced by the Megaparsec shipyard. It is designed to be faster and more maneuverable than other ships of a similar size, in order to serve as a heavy escort ship or as part of a planetary defense and patrol fleet. Because of its intended use in merchant convoys, it also has a fair amount of cargo space."
