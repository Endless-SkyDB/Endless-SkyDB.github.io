	"description": "This Arrow has had numerous modifications to its hull and internal systems to make more room for outfits - mostly with combat in mind. More shields, weapons, engines, outfit space, and a turret mount nearly push this ship into the Light Warship category, and definitely make it one of the heaviest Interceptors you're likely to find."
