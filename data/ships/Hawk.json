	"description": "The Tarazed Hawk is an interceptor-class warship often used as an escort for freighters or in a planetary militia's patrol squadron. Hawks are fast enough to chase down most smaller ships, while also being much more heavily armed and armored. They are also, of course, a favorite ship of pirate captains who have earned enough money to afford one."
