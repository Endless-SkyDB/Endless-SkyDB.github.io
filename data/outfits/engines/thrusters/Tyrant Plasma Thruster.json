		"The enormous crate that this thruster is sold in comes decorated with a picture of a grinning Tyrannosaurus Rex with an improbable number of teeth. Only a handful of ships are large enough to require an engine of this size... or to have the capacity for one.",
		"Plasma engines are a bit more powerful than ion engines of the same size, but they are less energy efficient and produce more heat."
