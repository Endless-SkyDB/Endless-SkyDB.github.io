	"description": "A legend among the Korath claims that when they were first testing out their latest generation of plasma thrusters, a concerned Quarg fleet approached and volunteered to help evacuate the Korath crew from what they assumed was a dying ship. The Quarg were surprised to learn that the flames shooting out the back of the ship were in fact its intended mode of propulsion."
