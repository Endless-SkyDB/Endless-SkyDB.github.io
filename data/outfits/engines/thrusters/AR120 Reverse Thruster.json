	"description": "For pilots who want to be able to pull fancy tricks that most ships are not capable of emulating, a reverse thruster allows a ship to accelerate backwards, without needing to turn around. Because a reverse thruster must be facing forwards, it must be installed in the weapon section of your ship instead of the engine section."
