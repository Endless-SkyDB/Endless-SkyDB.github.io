	"description": "`When designing the Barb, the Syndicate took the opportunity to integrate their smallest thruster models to create a more compact steering and thrusting engine. The result is not very useful on anything but a fighter, and is only adequate in that role. Still, if engine space is at a premium, this is the smallest set of engines that will still get you there (eventually).`"
