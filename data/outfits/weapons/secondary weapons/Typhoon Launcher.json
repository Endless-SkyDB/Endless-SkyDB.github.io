	"description": "Typhoon Torpedoes are an improved torpedo technology; they do considerably more damage than ordinary torpedoes. However, they are also much slower, because they are intended mostly for use against large and slow-moving capital ships. As a result, sufficiently skilled pilots can often dodge around them."
