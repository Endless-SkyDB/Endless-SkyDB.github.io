	"description": "The Heavy Laser is an upgraded Beam Laser with a significantly longer range and higher power. It is mostly intended for larger ships, where energy and space are plentiful, but some pilots consider a single Heavy Laser to be a worthwhile alternative to a pair of Beam Lasers, because the longer range makes up for the fact that it does not quite deal twice as much damage."
