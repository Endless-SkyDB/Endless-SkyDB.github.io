	"description": "Ion cannons do not inflict as much damage as some other weapons, but they disrupt the electrical systems on any ship they hit, draining its energy. If a ship has sizable battery reserves, this may not have any effect, but for a ship running at near its energy generation capacity an ion strike can take it out of the battle for a few seconds while it recovers."
