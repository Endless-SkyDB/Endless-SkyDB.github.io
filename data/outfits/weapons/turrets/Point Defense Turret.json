	"description": "Not long after the Remnant settled on Aventine, they began to discover caches of alien technology in vaults deep under the mountains, guarded by ancient but still-functioning point-defense systems. The Remnant learned how to duplicate those defense systems, and they are now considered to be much more useful than most of the items that they were guarding."
