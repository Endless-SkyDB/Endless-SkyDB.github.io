	"description": "In response to occasional raids by the robotic war machines left behind after their recent conflict, the Kor Efret have developed this minimal, spartan command center that can be installed in a captured robotic ship to allow a pilot to override the AI and interface with the ship's controls. The command center only provides a single bunk for the captain, so more may be necessary if the ship has turrets or other systems that require crew."
